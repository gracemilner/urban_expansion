# urban_expansion
Using an Agent-Based model to predict patterns of urban expansion in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia by 2033.

## About
This script was developed as part of a project investigating the strengths and weaknesses of Agent-Base models in land allocation exercises.

The script uses population growth estimates and input data regarding suitability for different types of urban expansion, as well as neighbourhood functions and ranking functions to determine most likely expansion patterns guided by most probable agent decision making.

The process is carried out in one-year planning episodes over a ten-year period.

Complexities such as reallocation and policy prioritisation are taken into account.

## Outputs
The output is a land cover prediction map.
